Under this repository I have covered my BITS Assignment - Flutter TO DO App

The app has below features:
- Adding task (separate screen )
- Editing task (separate screen )
- Marking Completion (gets turned green to symbolize the Completion)
- Deleting task
- Filtering the task based on the Completion status
- Each task has created and completed date info
- Tasks get sorted based completion and created time stamp
